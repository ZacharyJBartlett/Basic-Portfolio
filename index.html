            <p>My name is Zachary. I grew up in a small town where most of the jobs were in the manufacturing industry. Growing up I knew that that was the field I would be going into. During and after my high school years, I spent time in that industry doing different jobs such as welding and quality control. I am current trying to learn a new trade so that I will be able to make a career change into a field that I will actually enjoy.</p>
